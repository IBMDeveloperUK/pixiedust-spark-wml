# Analyse Customer Data and Recommend Products with PixieDust
 
An example of a same-day grocery delivery service is used to show you how to:

1. Explore and analyze customer behavior information (such as demographics and shopping cart values)
2. Build a machine learning recommendation engine to encourage additional purchases based on past buying behavior

IBM Cloud and open source tools and services, including Jupyter Notebooks, Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, Streams Designer, Watson Machine Learning and IBM Cloud Object Storage are used.

### Before you start

[Sign up](https://ibm.biz/BdZCKW) for an IBM Cloud account and access [Watson Studio](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-studio).

Or install Python and Jupyter through [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) to run the notebooks from the workshop on your own machine and follow [these steps](https://ibm-watson-data-lab.github.io/pixiedust/install.html) to create a Jupyter kernel with Python2.7 and Spark2.1. But note that you will still need an IBM Cloud account to access the Watson Machine Learning APIs.
