# Build a Product Recommendation Engine and Revenue Dashboard with PixieDust 

An example of a same-day grocery delivery service is used to show you how to:

1. Explore and analyze customer behavior information (such as demographics and shopping cart values)
2. Build a machine learning recommendation engine to encourage additional purchases based on past buying behavior
3. Build a revenue dashboard

IBM Cloud and open source tools and services, including Jupyter Notebooks, Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, Streams Designer, Watson Machine Learning and IBM Cloud Object Storage are used.
