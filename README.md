# Analyse Customer Data and Recommend Products with PixieDust
 
An example of a same-day grocery delivery service is used to show you how to:

1. Explore and analyze customer behavior information (such as demographics and shopping cart values)
2. Build a machine learning recommendation engine to encourage additional purchases based on past buying behavior

IBM Cloud and open source tools and services, including Jupyter Notebooks, Apache Spark and Watson Machine Learning are used.
