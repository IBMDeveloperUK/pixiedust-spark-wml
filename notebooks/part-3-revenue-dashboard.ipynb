    "\n",
    "This notebook is divided into three parts. In part 1 we capture clickstream events that indicate that a customer has made a purchase and  enrich these events by adding geolocation information. Using this information we aggregate the total revenue by ZIP code (for US-based transactions) or country code (for international transactions) and periodically write totals (representing revenue) to generic cloud storage (represented in this scenario by a bucket in Cloud Object Storage). In part 2 we add the aggregated data to a Watson Data Platform catalog and in part 3 we use a PixieApp to browse the catalog using the Watson Data Platform API and visualize revenue information.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. [Select (or create) a project](https://dataplatform.ibm.com/projects?context=analytics) that you want to contain the streams flow. Note that this project must be attached to Cloud Object Storage and not Object Storage (Swift).\n",
    "1. Click the **Assets** tab and scroll to the _Streams flows_ section. \n",
    " > If no section with the name is displayed the selected project is not attached to Cloud Object Storage.\n",
    " \n",
    " > If there is still no section with the name in the selected project go [here](https://dataplatform.ibm.com/streams/pipelines) to find the *Streams flows*. Or copy your projectid into this URL `https://dataplatform.ibm.com/streams/pipelines?projectid=<projectid>` (you can find the projectid from the URL of your project page: for example `https://dataplatform.ibm.com/projects/<projectid>/overview?context=wdp/` )\n",

    "  1. Click **Create**. Wait for the import to complete.\n",

    "1. Review the flow. It comprises of one source operator (Message Hub), a [Python] code operator (retrieving customer geolocation information from the Cloud), two filter operators (separating US transactions from international transactions), two aggregation operators (one for each major geography, calculating the revenue) and two Cloud Object Storage target operators, saving the aggregated data for later processing.\n",
